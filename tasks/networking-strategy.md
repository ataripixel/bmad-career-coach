# Networking Strategy Development

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Networking strategy development cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you complete networking strategy development without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Career Context

If career context has not been provided, ask the user to provide their industry, career goals, current network, and networking objectives.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present networking strategy prompts and questions
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain why these questions matter for networking)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Continue with next networking area"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Completing networking strategy development for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Assess current network** - Understand existing connections and relationships
2. **Define networking goals** - Clarify what you want to achieve through networking
3. **Identify target connections** - Determine who you need to connect with
4. **Develop outreach strategy** - Plan how to approach and engage with contacts
5. **Create engagement plan** - Design ongoing relationship building activities
6. **Establish metrics** - Define how to measure networking success

- Examples of successful networking strategies
- How to build authentic, mutually beneficial relationships

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with networking insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply insights and continue strategy development**
   - **2. Return to networking strategy menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Strategy Documentation

For each networking component:

1. **Current State** - What is your current networking situation?
2. **Target State** - What do you want to achieve?
3. **Action Plan** - What specific actions will you take?
4. **Timeline** - When will you implement each action?
5. **Success Metrics** - How will you measure success?
6. **Follow-up Plan** - How will you maintain relationships?

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining the importance of each area
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
