# Career Strategy Planning

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Career strategy planning cannot be completed without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you complete career strategy planning without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Career Context

If career context has not been provided, ask the user to provide their current career situation, goals, and aspirations.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present strategy planning prompts and questions
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain why these questions matter for career strategy)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Continue with next strategy area"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Completing career strategy planning for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Assess current career situation** - Understand where the user is now
2. **Define career vision** - Help articulate long-term career goals
3. **Identify skill gaps** - Analyze current vs. required capabilities
4. **Create action plan** - Develop specific, measurable steps
5. **Set milestones** - Establish checkpoints and timelines
6. **Review and refine** - Validate the strategy and make adjustments

## Strategy Planning Focus Areas

### Current Situation Assessment
- **Career Stage Analysis** - Where are you in your career journey?
- **Strengths Inventory** - What are your core competencies and advantages?
- **Weaknesses Identification** - What areas need development?
- **Market Position** - How do you compare to peers and competitors?

### Career Vision Development
- **Long-term Goals** - Where do you want to be in 5-10 years?
- **Role Aspirations** - What positions or responsibilities do you seek?
- **Industry Direction** - Which industries or sectors interest you?
- **Geographic Preferences** - Where do you want to work?

### Skill Gap Analysis
- **Technical Skills** - What technical competencies are needed?
- **Leadership Skills** - What management and leadership capabilities are required?
- **Industry Knowledge** - What domain expertise is necessary?
- **Soft Skills** - What interpersonal and communication skills are important?

### Action Plan Creation
- **Short-term Goals** - What can you achieve in the next 6-12 months?
- **Medium-term Objectives** - What milestones should you reach in 1-3 years?
- **Learning Priorities** - What skills should you develop first?
- **Network Building** - Who should you connect with?

### Implementation Strategy
- **Resource Requirements** - What time, money, or support do you need?
- **Timeline Development** - When should each milestone be achieved?
- **Risk Assessment** - What obstacles might you encounter?
- **Success Metrics** - How will you measure progress?

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting strategy planning prompts, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Why this area is critical for career success
- How this planning will benefit long-term career growth
- Specific examples of successful career strategies
- How to balance short-term needs with long-term vision

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with strategic insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply insights and continue strategy planning**
   - **2. Return to strategy planning menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Strategy Documentation

For each strategy component identified:

1. **Current State** - Where are you now?
2. **Target State** - Where do you want to be?
3. **Gap Analysis** - What's the difference?
4. **Action Steps** - What specific actions will bridge the gap?
5. **Timeline** - When will each step be completed?
6. **Success Criteria** - How will you know you've succeeded?

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining the importance of each area
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
